This is a "slither" type game programmed with Python using Pygame. One player plays with number keys, and the other plays with WASD. 

To install and run the game:

1. Install pip https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/
2. pip install pygame https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted
3. Download and unzip the github repository
4. Open command prompt and navigate to tom_vs_the_bad_man.py, then run it. For me on windows, the command is "python tom_vs_the_bad_man.py", but I think it's different depending on your OS and python version.
